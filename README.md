## requirements

- [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (for installing dependencies) - MacOs only
- [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) (for installing rust analyzer)

## Where to put my dotfiles? 

### MacOs
1. Create a folder in your home directory called `.config`
2. Clone this repo into the `.config` folder
3. Run `nvim_setup.sh` to install the necessary dependencies

```sh
git clone https://github.com/R2-t/Santiago.nvim.config.git $HOME/.config/nvim/
```
